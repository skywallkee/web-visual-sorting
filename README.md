# Web Visual Sorting

### This project is for the ones that are having trouble imagining the algorithm, thus making it harder for them to remember how to implement it or use it properly.

What does it make different compared to other Web Visual Sortings?
- Possibility to have up to 550 elements, making it easier to see how these sorting algorithms perform on large scale datas
- Can track your algorithm time from the moment it started until the end, it will time the execution
- Many algorithms to chose from, even some not very "common"
- Selectable speed, from going very slow so you can keep track of every single move to very fast where the algorithm will perform at it's best
- You can choose your own array, or even do it random by giving it the minimum and maximum length of the array
- Really simple to use compared to other websites with not labeled buttons and overwhelmingly many options to do one simple task
- It's colored :) so you can remember it easier the next time you think of it
